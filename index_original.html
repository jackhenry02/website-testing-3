                <div class="header">Blackjack Rules</div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The object of Blackjack is very simple: to achieve a total that is greater than that of the dealer, and which does not exceed 21. Even if other players are present at the table, the dealer is your only opponent in the game.</p>
                    Play progresses as follows:<ol><li>A card is dealt, face up, to each player in turn and then one to the dealer. The dealer's card is face down and called the "hole" card.</li><li>A second card is then dealt, again face up, to each player.</li><li>Starting from the player to the left of the dealer, each player decides whether to draw further cards.</li><li>After all players have completed their hands, the Dealer proceeds to draw cards to complete the Dealer's hand.</li></ol>You win if:<ol><li>Your total is higher than the Dealer's total</li><li>The Dealer goes over 21 or "busts".</li></ol><p>If your total is the same as the Dealer's total it is a "stand-off" and you neither win nor lose.</p><p>If you go over 21, or the Dealer's total is greater, you lose.</p><p><strong>Things to remember:</strong> Picture Cards (Jack, Queen and King) each count as 10 points. An Ace counts as 1 point or 11 points, whichever is better for owner of the hand. All other cards have their numerical face value.</p><p>Blackjack is a combination of an Ace and any 10 or picture card with your first two cards. It pays one and a half times your bet unless the dealer also draws Blackjack, in which case you have a "stand-off".</p><p>The dealer plays according to a strict set of rules. Dealers must take another card if their hand totals 16 or less. Dealers must stand (not take any more cards) if their hand totals 17 or more.</p><p><strong>Splitting:</strong> If your first two cards are of equal value you may split these to form two seperate hands. If you receive futher equal value cards on your split hands, you may split again to a limit of four seperate hands. Aces may be split to form only two hands. You will receive an additional card for each hand, however a wager equal to your original bet must be placed each time you split.</p><p><strong>Doubling Down:</strong> You may place an additional bet (not exceeding your original bet) if your first two cards total 9,10 or 11 (without aces). You will be dealt one additional card, and one additional card only, when you double.</p><p><strong>Insurance:</strong> If the first card dealt to the dealer is an ace, the dealer will announce "Insurance". You may then place an insurance bet of no more than half your original bet, to insure your hand should the dealer make Blackjack.</p><p>An insurance bet is paid at odds of 2 to 1 and will only win if the dealer makes Blackjack. If the dealer does not make Blackjack the insurance bet is lost.</p><p><strong>Note: 5 card tricks do not count in Blackjack.</strong></p><button type="button" class="ui primary button modal-close">Close</button>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Churchill Casino plays Texas Hold 'Em Poker on all our poker tables, using standard rules.</p><h3>The Shuffle, The Deal and The Blinds</h3><p>The dealer shuffles a standard 52-card deck.</p><p>At Churchill casino, the dealer never plays. A round disc known as a "dealer button", moves clockwise from player to player with each hand. The button marks which player would be the dealer if the deal were advanced from player to player as the game went along.</p><p>Most Texas Hold 'Em Poker games start with the two players to the left of the dealer (the button) putting a predetermined amount of money into the pot before any cards are dealt, ensuring that there's something to play for on every hand.</p><p>This is called "posting the blinds." Most often, the "small blind", the player to the left of the dealer, puts up half the minimum bet, and the "big blind" puts up the full minimum bet.</p><p>Occasionally, Churchill Casino uses an 'ante' betting system. At the discretion of the dealer, a predetermined amount, the 'ante', is bet by all players at the table wishing to be dealt a hand, before any cards are dealt. This replaces posting the blinds.</p><p>Each player is dealt two cards, face down. These are known as the "hole cards."</p><h3>Betting Begins</h3><p>A round of betting takes place, beginning with the player to the left of the two who posted the blinds. Players can call, raise, or fold when it's their turn to bet.</p><h3>The Flop</h3><p>After the first betting round, the dealer discards the top card of the deck. This is called burning the card and is done to ensure that no one accidentally saw the top card, and to help prevent cheating.</p><p>The dealer then flips the next three cards face up on the table. These cards are called the "flop."</p><strong>Note:</strong> Eventually, a total of five community cards will be placed face up on the table. Players can use any combination of the community cards and their own two hole cards to form the best possible five-card Poker hand.<p>After the flop, another round of betting takes place, beginning with the player to the left of the dealer (the button). During this and all future rounds of betting, players can check, call, raise, or fold when it's their turn to bet.</p><h3>The Turn</h3><p>The dealer burns another card and plays one more face up onto the table. This, the fourth community card, is called the "turn" or "Fourth Street."</p><p>The player to the left of the dealer (the button) begins the third round of betting.</p><h3>River</h3><p>The dealer burns another card before placing the final face-up card on the table. This card is called the "river" or "Fifth Street."</p><h3>Final Betting and The Winner</h3><p>Players can now use any combination of seven cards, the five community cards and the two hole cards known only to them, to form the best possible five-card Poker hand.</p><p>The fourth and final round of betting starts with the player to the left of the dealer (the button).</p><p>After the final betting round, all players who remain in the game reveal their hands. The player who made the initial bet or the player who made the last raise shows their hand first.</p><p>The player with the best hand wins.</p><p>Texas Hold 'Em poker uses the same rules as standard five-card poker to determine who has the best hand, but better hands are more likely than with standard five-card poker, as the player is selecting the best five-card hand from seven cards.</p><p>Standard five-card Poker hands are ranked here in order of strength, from the strongest Poker hand to the weakest.</p><ul><li><strong>Royal Flush: </strong>This is the best possible hand in standard five-card Poker. Ace, King, Queen, Jack and 10, all of the same suit.</li><li><strong>Straight Flush </strong>Any five-card sequence in the same suit (e.g.: 8, 9, 10, Jack and Queen of clubs; or 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of diamonds).</li><li><strong>Four of a Kind </strong>All four cards of the same value (e.g.: 8, 8, 8, 8; or Queen, Queen, Queen, Queen).</li><li><strong>Full House</strong> Three of a kind combined with a pair (e.g.: 10, 10, 10 with 6, 6; or King, King, King with 5, 5).</li><li><strong>Flush </strong>Any five cards of the same suit, but not in sequence (e.g.: 4, 5, 7, 10 and King of spades).</li><li><strong>Straight </strong>Five cards in sequence, but not in the same suit (e.g.: 7 of clubs, 8 of clubs, 9 of diamonds, 10 of spades and Jack of diamonds).</li><li><strong>Three of a Kind </strong>Three cards of the same value (e.g.: 3, 3, 3; or Jack, Jack, Jack).</li><li><strong>Two Pair </strong>Two separate pairs (e.g.: 2, 2, Queen, Queen).</li><li><strong>Pair </strong>Two cards of the same value (e.g.: 7, 7).</li><li><strong>High Card </strong>If a Poker hand contains none of the above combinations, it's valued by the highest card in it.</li></ul><button type="button" class="ui primary button modal-close">Close</button>

                <div class="header">Craps Rules</div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Craps is one of the most exciting games in the casino. Churchill Casino plays craps slightly differently to other casinos, as almost everyone playing is a beginner, and we like to make it easy and uncomplicated. Hence we make sure all bets are removed at the 'end of the game' to allow easy understanding of the rules. We also divide the game into 2 clear phases and you can only place two types of bet in 'first phase'.</p><p>Play starts off with a designated thrower, who throws the two dice down the table. If you are not throwing the dice you can bet on the thrower.</p><p>A new game then begins with a new shooter. If the current shooter has made his Point, the dice are returned to him and he then begins the new Come Out roll. When the shooter has failed to make his or her Point, the dice are then offered to the next player for a new Come Out roll and the game continues in the same manner. The first player to place a bet on the pass line is the new shooter.</p><p>The first roll of the dice in a betting round is the first Phase of the game called the Come Out roll - a new game in Craps begins with the Come Out roll. The game ends after one roll if the come out roll is natural (7,11) or craps (2,3,12). If a different number is rolled, then this becomes the 'point' and you move into second phase. The game ends when either the point is reached or a seven is rolled. When this occurs, all bets on the table win, lose or are 'pushed' back to the player.</p><p>The dice are rolled across the craps table layout. The layout is divided into three areas - two side areas separated by a centre one. Each side area is the mirror reflection of the other and contains the following: Pass and Don't Pass line bets, Come and Don't Come bets, Place bets and Field bets. The centre area is shared by both side areas and contains the Proposition bets.</p><p>Below is a list of the various bets you can make at craps.</p><p>In first phase, before the come out roll, only two kinds of bets may be placed: Pass and don't pass. In second phase, when a point is set, pass and don't pass bets are not available, but the rest of the table is open to bets. Pass, don't pass, come and don't come all pay out evens (1:1)</p><ul><li><strong>Pass Line Bet:</strong> You win if the first roll (first phase) is a natural (7, 11) and lose if it is craps (2, 3, 12). If a point is rolled (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10), you move into second phase and the point must be repeated before a 7 is thrown in order to win. If 7 is rolled before the point you lose. The bet remains on the table until either the point or a seven is thrown, when the game ends.</li><li><strong>Don't Pass Line Bet</strong> This is the reversed Pass Line bet. If the first roll of a dice is a natural (7, 11) you lose and if it is a 2 or a 3 you win. A dice roll of 12 means you have a tie or push with the casino. If the roll is a point (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10), in second phase a 7 must come out before that point is repeated to make you a winner. If the point is rolled again before the 7 you lose. Like the pass line bet, the bet remains on the table until the end of the game.</li><li><strong>Come Bet:</strong> It has the same rules as the Pass Line bet. The difference consists in the fact you can make this bet only in second phase. After you place your bet the first dice roll will set the come point. On the first roll after the bet is placed, you win if it is a natural (7, 11) and lose if it is craps (2, 3, 12). Other rolls will determine the come point. You win if the come point is repeated before a 7 is rolled. If a 7 is rolled first you lose. If the original point is rolled, the bet is returned or 'pushed' to the player.</li><li><strong>Don't Come Bet:</strong> The reversed Come Bet. Before the come point has been established you win if it is a 2 or 3 and lose for 7 or 11. 12 is a tie. Once the come point is determined, you win if 7 is rolled before the come point is rolled again.</li><li><strong>Place Bets:</strong> This bet works only in second phase and is a single roll only bet. You can bet on a dice roll of 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10. You win if the number you placed your bet on is rolled and lose if any other number is rolled. The bet pays out the following: 4 and 10, 7:1; 5 and 9, 6:1; 6 and 8, 5:1.</li><li><strong>Field Bets:</strong> These bets are for one dice roll only and are only allowed in second phase. If a 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12 is rolled you win. A 5, 6, 7 and 8 make you lose. Field Bets have the following different payoffs: 2 and 12 pay double (2:1). Other winning dice rolls pays even (1:1).</li><li><strong>Big Six, Big Eight Bets:</strong> Placed at any roll of dice these bets win if a 6 or 8 comes out before a 7 is rolled. Big Six and Big Eight are even bets and are paid at 1:1.</li><li><strong>Proposition Bets:</strong> These bets can be made at any time and, except for the hardways, they are all one roll bets:<ul><li>Any Craps: Wins if a 2, 3 or 12 is thrown. Payoff 8:1</li><li>Any Seven: Wins if a 7 is rolled. Payoff 5:1</li><li>Eleven: Wins if a 11 is thrown. Payoff 16:1</li><li>Ace Duece: Wins if a 3 is rolled. Payoff 16:1</li><li>Aces or Boxcars: Wins if a 2 or 12 is thrown. Payoff 30:1</li><li>Horn Bet: it acts as the bets on 2, 3, 11 and 12 all at once. Wins if one of these numbers is rolled. Payoff is determined according to the number rolled. The other three bets are lost.</li><li>Hardways: The bet on a hardway number wins if it's thrown hard (sum of pairs: 1-1, 3-3, 4-4...) before it's rolled easy and a 7 is thrown. Payoffs: Hard 4 and 10, 8:1; Hard 6 and 8, 10:1</li></ul></li></ul><button type="button" class="ui primary button modal-close">Close</button>

                    <p>Players play against the house represented by the croupier also called the dealer, who spins the roulette wheel and handles the wagers and payouts. In Churchill Casino the wheel has 37 slots representing 36 numbers and one zero.</p><p>To play roulette, you place your bet or bets on numbers (any number including the zero) in the table layout or on the outside, and when everybody at the table had a chance to place their bets, the croupier starts the spin and launches the ball. Just a few moments before the ball is about to drop over the slots, the croupier says 'no more bets'. From that moment no one is allowed to place - or change - their bets until the ball drops on a slot. Only after the croupier places the dolly on the winning number on the roulette table and clears all the losing bets you can then start placing your new bets while the croupier pays the winners. The winners are those bets that are on or around the number that comes up. Also the bets on the outside of the layout win if the winning number is represented.</p><h3>The Payouts:</h3><p>A bet on one number only, called a straight-up bet, pays 35 to 1. (ie. You collect 36.)<br>A two-number bet, called split bet, pays 17 to 1.<br>A three-number bet, called street bet, pays 11 to 1.<br>A four-number bet, called corner bet, pays 8 to 1.<br>A six-number bet, pays 5 to 1.<br>A bet on the outside dozen or column, pays 2 to 1.<br>A bet on the outside even money bets, pays 1 to 1.</p><p>Any pretentious linguists may pull out some of these terms:</p><h3>Inside bets</h3><ul><li>One number Straight up = En plein</li><li>Two numbers Split Bet = Cheval</li><li>Three numbers Street Bet = Transversale</li><li>Four numbers Corner = Carre</li><li>Six numbers Line Bet = Sixainne</li></ul><h3>Outside bets</h3><ul><li>Twelve numbers Column = Colonne</li><li>Twelve numbers Dozen = Douzaine</li><li>Red or Black = Rouge, Noir</li><li>Even or Odd = Pair, Impair</li><li>Low or High numbers = Manque, Passe</li></ul><button type="button" class="ui primary button modal-close">Close</button>
